# landing-page

This landing page is the TOP project concluding the "Flexbox" section of the Foundations course. 

Its goal is to put into practice and include everything that has been reviewed in the course up to this point:
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - Flexbox layout

As well as the parallel skills of using Git and Github. 

It is very much a first iteration and a work in progress, and will be revisited throughout the curriculum. For now, the goal was to replicate the layout of the assignement.
