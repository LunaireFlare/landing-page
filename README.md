# [The Odin Project Foundations Course: Landing page]
## Overview

This [landing page project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page) concludes the HTML and CSS sections of the Odin Project Foundations curriculum, and aims to put into practice the knowledge acquired up to this point by **replicating a basic web page**.

>**Worth noting**: The current version is very much a first iteration and a work in progress, and will be revisited in the future. For now, the goal was to replicate the layout of the assignement.

## Description
**Live version**: available [here](lunaireflare.github.io/landing-page/).
